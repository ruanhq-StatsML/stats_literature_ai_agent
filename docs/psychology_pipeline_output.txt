Based on the results from the relevant query searches, it appears there is limited direct research connecting specific psychological theories and methodologies directly to e-commerce platforms in the academic databases searched. While these theories are prevalent and influential in understanding human behavior, their direct application in ongoing e-commerce research appears to be limited or not fully explored thus requiring additional research.

However, there is significant indirect evidence suggesting these psychological theories can be effectively applied to e-commerce platforms from other domains of research, as well as widespread industry practices.

1. **Behavioral Psychology Methods**: Many e-commerce companies leverage principles of classical and operant conditioning to reward user behavior, but direct supportive research is lacking. Habit formation research is common in health behavior modification, which can be translated to habit formation in e-commerce settings; Fogg's Behavior Model, for example, suggests behavior change occurs at the intersection of motivation, ability, and prompts. Additionally, "nudge" theory is frequently employed by businesses to improve customer experience and increase sales. 

2. **Cognitive Psychology Frameworks**: Attention and perception studies form the core of website design principles being used currently. Existing research on memory and recall can be applied to product discovery to improve users' ability to remember and locate desired products. Information processing and mental model theories can inform the development of intuitive interfaces and workflows.

3. **Social Psychology Principles**: Social proof principles (e.g., user ratings and reviews) are widely employed in e-commerce to influence purchase decisions. Theories around reciprocity and commitment can guide strategies for customer retention and sales. Scarcity and urgency effects are also common principles used to drive purchase behavior.

4. **Consumer Psychology Research**: Psychological principles related to price perception and anchoring inform pricing strategies in e-commerce. Similarly, emotional vs. rational decision-making principles guide advertising and marketing tactics.

5. **User Experience Psychology**: Creating immersive shopping experiences can potentially evoke a flow state, improving satisfaction and sales. There's a known aesthetic-usability effect in design, implying a possible influence of platform aesthetics on user behavior in e-commerce. The Peak-end rule can be applied to shape the customer journey and improve overall satisfaction, although research specific to e-commerce seems limited. 

For each specific domain, more specialized research may be necessary to identify key researchers, seminal papers, and core methodologies. Further experimental research will also be needed to quantify the impact of these psychological applications on e-commerce user behavior and sales.

APPLICATIONS AGENT OUTPUT:
==================================================
Unfortunately, direct examples or case studies showcasing the application of psychological methodologies in e-commerce platforms seems to be limited or not directly available through web search. There might be due to the proprietary nature of these strategies by e-commerce platforms.

However, aspects of these methodologies are inevitably incorporated into many e-commerce business strategies broadly. Here are some generalized examples without specific metrics based on the common practices in the industry:

1. **Behavioral Psychology in E-commerce**: E-commerce platforms often leverage reward systems to incentivize certain user behaviors. For example, a common practice is to offer discounts or points for repeat purchases, encouraging the habit of returning to the platform (akin to operant conditioning). Personalized recommendations based on user's browsing and buying history can be seen as an application of habit formation theory, where the system learns and adapts to the user's behavior over time.

2. **Cognitive Psychology in E-commerce**: Amazon's easy-to-navigate user interface and intuitive category grouping are examples of good information architecture, designed based on principles of mental modeling from cognitive psychology.

3. **Social Psychology in E-commerce**: Ratings and reviews displayed on product pages on platforms like Amazon and eBay apply principles of social proof, influencing potential buyers' decision-making process.

4. **Consumer Psychology in E-commerce**: The application of price anchoring can be seen in how products are often presented with a higher "original price" crossed out next to a "sale price". This strategy encourages the perception of a good deal.

5. **User Experience Psychology in E-commerce**: Peak-end rule principle may be implemented at the end of the transaction process where customers are provided with a satisfying thank you message, reinforcing a positive experience.

These applications are typically targeted at improving user engagement, session time, conversion rates, and overall user satisfaction, although direct measurements and success metrics, particularly referring to specific companies like Amazon, Netflix, or Booking.com, are hard to acquire due to their proprietary nature.

PRODUCT MANAGER AGENT OUTPUT:
==================================================
1. **Problem Statement**: Users of e-commerce platforms often struggle with decision fatigue due to overwhelming product choices, and are not always effectively influenced or guided by the platform to make purchases that best meet their needs. The platform also lacks effective strategies for encouraging repeat visits and purchases.

2. **User Personas**
   - **Bargain Hunter Beth** - Beth is price-focused and always looking for great deals. She enjoys the thrill of finding a discount and is more likely to purchase items with visible savings.
   - **Influence-Driven Ian** - Ian often checks ratings and reviews and cares about what other people are buying. He makes purchase decisions heavily influenced by social proof.
   - **Habitual Shopper Helen** - Helen buys the same items frequently and appreciates quick and straightforward repeat purchase options.
   - **Occasional Buyer Owen** - Owen only shops when he needs a specific item. He appreciates clear navigation and efficient search functionalities.

3. **Feature Prioritization**
   - **Discount Badge** (*Price Anchoring, Bargain Hunter Beth*) - A feature highlighting savings on discounted products. Metrics: Sales of discounted products.
   - **User Reviews and Ratings** (*Social Proof, Influence-Driven Ian*) - Providing a space for and promoting user reviews. Metrics: Percent of purchases with reviewed items and overall platform sales.
   - **Repeat Order Prompt** (*Operant Conditioning, Habitual Shopper Helen*) - A feature enabling quick repeat orders of previously purchased items. Metrics: Repeat order rate.
   - **Efficient Search and Suggestions** (*Cognitive Processing, Occasional Buyer Owen*) - Improving search functionality and personalized suggestions based on past purchases. Metrics: User engagement and conversion rate.
   - **Time-Limited Sales Timer** (*Scarcity Principle, all personas*) - Displaying time left on sales items. Metrics: Sales during time-limited offers.

4. **MVP Definition** - The following 3 features should be in MVP:
   - **User Reviews and Ratings**
   - **Repeat Order Prompt**
   - **Efficient Search and Suggestions**

5. **Ethical Framework** 
   - Ensure honest representation of product information and user reviews.
   - Provide fair and transparent pricing details and discourage artificial scarcity strategies.
   - Respect user privacy and seek consent where necessary, especially in data collection and personalization functionalities.
   - Maintain the trust of the users and provide them with options to control and manage their data.

6. **Go-to-Market Considerations**
   - Highlight the user-centric design of the platform, focusing on the simplicity and effectiveness of decision-making.
   - Promote the tailored shopping experiences for different types of users.
   - Ensure that value propositions are communicated effectively in all promotional materials.

STATISTICS AGENT OUTPUT:
==================================================
I'm sorry, I was unable to find academic papers on the specific topic of your request. However, below are some common approaches and best practices in designing an A/B testing framework in e-commerce, and how they could potentially be applied to psychology-based features:

1. **Experiment Design**
   - **Sample size requirements**: The sample size for each test should be large enough to detect a statistically significant difference in key metrics between the control and experiment group. The required sample size can be estimated using power analysis, which considers the expected effect size, desired statistical significance level (usually 0.05), and statistical power (usually 0.8).
   - **Randomization considerations**: Users should be randomly assigned to the control or experiment group to ensure that the groups are comparable and any observed differences can be attributed to the introduced feature. Randomization should be done at the user level rather than the session level to avoid contamination effects.
   - **Duration**: The test should run long enough to capture enough data for statistical significance and to account for any novelty effects or user adaptation to new features. The exact duration may vary depending on the feature, but a typical test might run for two to four weeks.

2. **Metrics Framework**
   - **Behavioral metrics**: These include click-through rates, time spent on page, navigation paths, and other measurable actions users take on the platform. These can provide insights into how users interact with new features.
   - **Psychological metrics**: These are more subjective and could include survey data on user trust and satisfaction. They can help understand how new features influence user perceptions.
   - **Business metrics**: These are the end goals of any feature change, such as conversion rates, average order value, and retention rates.

3. **Early Stopping Considerations**
   - **Psychological effects**: Some features may have longer-term psychological effects that are not immediately observable. In such cases, early stopping may miss these effects.
   - **Novelty vs. habituation**: Users may initially respond to a new feature out of novelty, which could gradually decrease over time as they become habituated. As such, running the test for a longer duration can provide more accurate results.
   - **Seasonal and contextual factors**: These factors can also influence user behavior. It's important to consider this when deciding whether to stop a test early.

4. **Segmentation Strategy**
   - **Psychological profile**: Users can be segmented according to their psychological profiles, as reflected in their shopping habits and preferences. This can provide more tailored and relevant testing.
   - **Customer lifecycle stage**: Different features may be more or less effective at different stages of the customer lifecycle, so it may be beneficial to segment users based on this.
   - **Product category**: Users may behave differently depending on the category of product they are browsing or buying, so this could also be a useful segmentation.

Remember, the implementation of this testing process will require collaboration between data scientists, user researchers, UX designers, and business stakeholders.
